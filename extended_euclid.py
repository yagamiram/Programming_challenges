What is extended euclid's algorithm?
Extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, which computes, 
besides the greatest common divisor of integers a and b, the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, that is integers x and y such that

ax + by = gcd(a, b).

How to find x and y values?
algorithm extended-gcd(x,y)
    if y = 0 then return(x, 1, 0)
    else
        (d, a, b) := extended-gcd(y, x mod y)
        return((d, b, a - (x div y) * b))
How it works?
d = gcd(y, x mod y)
so 
d = gcd(y, x mod y) = ay + (x mod y)b 

this become 

d = bx + (a-(x/y)b)y
