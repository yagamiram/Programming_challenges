Segment Intersection
'''

Check if two line segements intersect to each other or not ?

How ?
Given : (A,B) and (C,D)
              | C
              |
    ----------|-------------                           
    A         |            B
              | D
1.  Check the area.

If the (area of ABC is positive and area of ABD is negative) AND (area of CDB is positive and CDA is negative) then the line segments 
intersect.

What if ?
       C
       |
       |
-------|-----------
A      D         B

This is also intersection of two line segments. But they cannot be found from the above formula.


So what to do ?

If the area of ABD is collinear and if D lies in between A and B then the lin segments intersect.

ALL OTHER CASES DO NOT INTERSECT.
